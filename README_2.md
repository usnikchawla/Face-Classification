# ENEE - Project2 - Part1(Deep Learning) and Part2 

This readme file are for running the Deep Learnig on MNIST and seeing the results of transfer Learning on Monkey dataset







## Authors

## Data set to run the code
For cnn on Mnist dataset there is no need for loading any kind of data set as the script automantically downloads and loads the data.

Download the Monkey datset from Kaggle(both testing and validation set) and place them in same folder as
simplecnn.py and transferlearning.py




## Deployment

For seeing the results of cnn on MNist datset run
```bash
  python3 cnn.python3
```
For seeing the results of a custom cnn on monkey dataset run

```bash
  python3 simplecnn.py
```

Foe seeing the result of a transfer learning ie ResNet 18 on monkey dataset run

```bash
  python3 transferlearning.py
```
## Dependencies

Install pytorch, numpy, scipy
